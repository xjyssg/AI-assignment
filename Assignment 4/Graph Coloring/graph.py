"""
The Graph class contains following information:

nb_nodes: number of nodes in the graph
nb_edges: number of edges in the graph
adjacent: adjacent list for each node of the graph
edges: list of all edges in graph

ATTENTION: index of node start from 1, i.e, if graph has V nodes,
we will have node 1, ..., V
